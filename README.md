Data was collected using the OpenWeather Weather API on 9/22/19.

Random coordinate pairs were generated using Numpy.

Citipy was used to find the closest city to each coordinate pair.

Each unique city was added to a list of cities to run through the Weather API.

Visualizations were generated using MatPlotLib.
